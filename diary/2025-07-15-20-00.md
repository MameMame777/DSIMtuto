# Debug Session - tb_top.sv

## Date
July 15, 2025 - 20:00

## Issue
- `axi4_if` interface was not properly defined, causing compilation errors
- UVM testbench was not properly structured with correct includes and imports
- Missing proper reset and clock initialization sequence
- `run.bat` was not including all necessary files for compilation

## Solution Applied
1. **Created `axi4_interface.sv`** - Complete AXI4 interface with all required signals
   - Added write address, data, and response channels
   - Added read address and data channels
   - Implemented master and slave modports for proper connectivity
   
2. **Updated `tb_top.sv`** - Fixed UVM integration issues
   - Added proper UVM includes and imports
   - Corrected clock and reset initialization sequence
   - Added UVM config database setup for virtual interface sharing
   - Implemented proper simulation timeout and waveform dumping
   
3. **Created `axi4_base_test.sv`** - Basic UVM test class
   - Implemented proper UVM test structure
   - Added virtual interface handling
   - Created basic test sequence with reset waiting
   
4. **Updated `run.bat`** - Fixed compilation command
   - Added all necessary SystemVerilog files to compilation list
   - Ensured proper file order for dependencies

## Technical Insights
- AXI4 interface requires careful signal management with proper modports
- UVM config database is essential for virtual interface sharing between components
- Proper reset sequence is critical for reliable simulation startup
- Clock initialization must be done before any other logic begins
- File compilation order matters for SystemVerilog dependencies

## Test Results

**Simple Testbench (No UVM):**
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS
- Elaboration: ✅ SUCCESS  
- Execution: ✅ SUCCESS
- Wave generation: ✅ waves.vcd created
- Test completion: ✅ at time 145ns

**UVM Testbench Issues:**
- ✅ RESOLVED: Initial UVM compilation failed due to incorrect command line options
- ✅ RESOLVED: DSim requires specific `-uvm <version>` flag for UVM support
- ✅ RESOLVED: Environment variable `$UVM_HOME` approach caused crashes

**UVM Testbench Success:**
- Compilation: ✅ SUCCESS with `-uvm 1.2` flag
- UVM Library: ✅ UVM-1.2 loaded successfully
- Test Execution: ✅ `Axi4_Base_Test` completed at time 145ns
- UVM Report: ✅ 6 INFO, 0 WARNING, 0 ERROR, 0 FATAL
- Virtual Interface: ✅ Properly configured via config database

**DSim UVM Requirements (from official documentation):**
- Use `-uvm <version>` option where version is 2020.3.1, 1.2, 1.1d, or 1.1b
- Compile: `dsim -uvm 1.2 <files>`
- Elaborate: `dsim -top <module> -genimage image -uvm 1.2`
- Run: `dsim -image image -uvm 1.2 +UVM_TESTNAME=<test>`

## Next Steps
- Add more comprehensive test scenarios
- Implement AXI4 transaction sequences
- Add assertion-based verification (SVA)
- Create proper UVM environment with agents and scoreboards
- Add coverage collection for functional verification

## Files Modified
