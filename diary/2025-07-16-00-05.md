## Task: Modify simulation execution to store output in exec directory

### Objective
- Modify the simulation execution system to store all output files in the `exec` directory
- Both .mxd and .vcd files should be stored in `exec` directory for better organization

### Implementation Status
1. ✅ Created `exec` directory in `src`
2. ✅ Modified `test_config.cfg` to specify .mxd files in `exec/` path
3. ✅ Updated all testbench files for VCD output to `exec/` directory:
   - `axi4_reg_mem_tb.sv`
   - `axi4_system_tb.sv` 
   - `simple_tb_top.sv`
   - `tb_top.sv`

### Current Status
- .mxd files are correctly generated in `exec` directory via DSIM -waves option
- VCD files are still being generated in current working directory instead of `exec` directory

### Issue Analysis
The `$dumpfile()` system task uses relative paths from the current working directory. Since DSIM runs from the `src` directory, the path `exec/filename.vcd` is resolved correctly for .mxd files (controlled by command line), but VCD files require the SystemVerilog to create the directory or use absolute paths.

### Next Steps
1. Need to investigate SystemVerilog file I/O for directory handling
2. Consider alternative approaches for VCD file placement
3. Test with other test configurations

### Technical Notes
- DSIM version: 20240422.0.0
- UVM version: 1.2
- .mxd files: Handled by DSIM command line option (-waves)
- .vcd files: Handled by SystemVerilog system tasks ($dumpfile, $dumpvars)

### Files Modified
- `src/test_config.cfg` - Updated wave file paths to include `exec/` prefix
- `tb/top/axi4_reg_mem_tb.sv` - Modified VCD output path
- `tb/top/axi4_system_tb.sv` - Modified VCD output path  
- `tb/top/simple_tb_top.sv` - Modified VCD output path
- `tb/top/tb_top.sv` - Modified VCD output path

### Test Results
- Test `axi4_reg_mem_basic` executed successfully
- .mxd file correctly generated in `exec/axi4_reg_mem_waves.mxd`
- VCD file generated in current directory instead of exec directory
