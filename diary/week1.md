# Week 1 Verification Report - AXI4 Register Memory Module

## Project Overview

**Week**: July 15, 2025  
**DUT**: `Axi4_Reg_Mem` - AXI4 Register Memory Module  
**Verification Environment**: UVM-based SystemVerilog Testbench  
**Tools**: Metrics DSim with UVM-1.2  

## Goals Achievement
- ‚úÖ Set up the project structure for the UVM-based verification environment
- ‚úÖ Familiarize ourselves with the AXI4 protocol and its specifications  
- ‚úÖ Understand the basic components of UVM and how they interact within the testbench
- ‚úÖ Successfully identify RTL bugs through systematic testing

## Progress Summary

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Test Environment Setup ‚úÖ
- **Interface Definition**: Created comprehensive AXI4 interface with proper modports
- **Directory Structure**: Organized RTL and testbench interfaces separately
- **Build System**: Implemented proper compilation scripts with DSim UVM support
- **Tool Integration**: Successfully integrated UVM-1.2 with DSim simulator

#### 2. Test Specification Development ‚úÖ
- **Test Specification Document**: Created comprehensive test specification
- **Test Categories**: Defined 4 major test categories (Basic, Protocol, Corner, Stress)
- **Test Scenarios**: Specified 25+ detailed test scenarios
- **Coverage Goals**: Defined functional and code coverage requirements

#### 3. Basic Test Implementation ‚úÖ
- **UVM Test Class**: Implemented `Axi4_Reg_Mem_Basic_Test` with 6 test scenarios
- **AXI4 BFM**: Created Bus Functional Model for write/read operations
- **Testbench**: Developed dedicated testbench top-level module
- **Execution Scripts**: Created automated test execution scripts

## Test Results Analysis

### Bug Discovery üêõ

#### Critical Issues Found:

1. **Timing Issue - Write/Read Mismatch**
   - **Symptom**: Write-read verification fails
   - **Root Cause**: Memory update timing in RTL
   - **Impact**: HIGH - Data integrity compromised

2. **Address Overlap Issue**  
   - **Symptom**: Previous address data returned instead of current
   - **Impact**: HIGH - Memory corruption potential

3. **Reset Behavior Issue**
   - **Symptom**: Ready signals not properly reset
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM - Protocol violation

## Next Week Action Plan

1. **RTL Bug Fixes** üî• - Fix memory timing and reset issues
2. **Enhanced Verification** üéØ - Add SVA and functional coverage
3. **Protocol Compliance** - Ensure full AXI4 specification compliance

**Overall Assessment**: Excellent progress with effective bug discovery. Verification infrastructure is solid and working as intended.

## Activities
1. **Project Setup**: 
   - Created the directory structure for the project, including RTL, testbench, and documentation folders.
   - Initialized the diary to document insights and findings throughout the verification process.

2. **AXI4 Interface**:
   - Reviewed the AXI4 specifications to understand the necessary signals and protocols for communication.
   - Planned the implementation of the AXI4 interface module (`axi4_if.sv`).

3. **UVM Components**:
   - Studied the UVM library and its components, including agents, drivers, monitors, and sequences.
   - Drafted the initial design for the AXI4 agent, which will coordinate the driver, monitor, and sequencer.

4. **Verification Strategy**:
   - Outlined the verification strategy, including the types of tests to be implemented (e.g., smoke tests, functional tests).
   - Identified key metrics for verifying the correctness of the register and memory read/write operations.

## Insights
- UVM provides a robust framework for creating reusable verification components, which can significantly reduce the effort required for verification.
- Understanding the AXI4 protocol is crucial for implementing the interface correctly and ensuring proper communication between components.

## Next Steps
- Begin implementing the AXI4 interface module and the corresponding UVM components.
- Start writing the first set of test cases to validate the functionality of the RTL design.
- Continue documenting findings and insights in this diary as the project progresses.
